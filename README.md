NS201 Assignment

*The Fair-Share Experiment: Did Your Sibling Cheat You Out of Soda?* ðŸ¥¤

Imagine this: Your mom hands you and your sibling one drink to share. We all know that moment of suspicionâ€”did they really split it equally?

I'm running a quick and fascinating academic experiment to measure the psychology of fairness. You'll be comparing two shares to help verify an essential *19th-century law of perception* (which we have to keep a secret for now!).

We need your sharp eyes and judgment!

*âœ… What you need to know:*
* *Time:* Takes just *5â€“7 minutes* (itâ€™s super fast, not 10 minutes!).
* *Who:* We welcome everyoneâ€”your siblings, friends, partners, and even your parents!
* *Link:*
